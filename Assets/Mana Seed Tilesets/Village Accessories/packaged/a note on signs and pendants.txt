In the "village accessories 16x16.png" file, you'll find a bunch of wooden signs for shops.
In the "village accessories 16x32.png" file you'll find a bunch of hanging cloth pendants with similar trade goods imagery.

Both the wooden signs and the cloth pendants are meant to go on top of their blank counterparts found in the other sheets:
"village accessories 32x32.png" and "village accessories 48x80.png" both have signposts equiped to hang a wooden sign or cloth banner.
You should make an object for the signpost in your game, then swap out a separate smaller object on top of it to represent the wooden or cloth sign part.
