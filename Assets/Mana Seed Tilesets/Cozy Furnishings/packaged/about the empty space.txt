These sheets have a lot of empty space, but that's intentional. It's to account for future updates.
I'll be filling out the different furniture styles over time so that each style has the same pieces of furniture.
I'll even be adding wholly new furniture styles to go along with the existing ones.
I'll also be adding more universal pieces that don't specifically match one of the styles.
In order to facilitate the sheets growing, I wanted them to have a maximum width (no more than 512 in this case) from the start.
That way, when I expand the sheets someday, I can add more to the bottom and it won't affect your cell counts.

If there are any particular pieces of furniture you'd like to see in a future update, please let me know in the comments section of the product.
