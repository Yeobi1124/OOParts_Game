Each tilesheet has a pair of numbers at the end of the filename: 16x16, 32x32, 64x48, etc.
This value is what you should slice the sheet at when you load it into your game engine.
But please note that many cells won't line up if your map editor is also set to those same dimensions.
Slice the sheets at whatever their filename calls for, but keep your map editor at 16x16!
This way you'll be able to slot the larger pieces together with some overlap of empty tiles within the cell, if necessary.
